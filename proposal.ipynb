    "**Research Topic**: Exploring Lifestyle Balance, Time Use Satisfaction, and Demographic Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 1: Demographic Influence on Time Use Balance for Core Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Question**: \n",
    "   - Does satisfaction with time spent on sleeping, working, and socializing differ across demographic groups such as age, gender, and specific identity groups (e.g., LGBTQ2+, Indigenous, people with disabilities)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Outcome Variables**: \n",
    "     - **Sleeping Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_sleeping`): Categorical variable with responses indicating whether individuals feel they spend \"too much,\" \"too little,\" or \"just the right amount\" of time sleeping.\n",
    "     - **Working Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_working`): Categorical variable with responses indicating if people feel they spend \"too much,\" \"too little,\" or \"just the right amount\" of time working.\n",
    "     - **Socializing Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_hanging`): Categorical variable with responses indicating if individuals feel they spend the right amount of time hanging out with friends.\n",
    "   - **Predictor Variables**: \n",
    "     - **Age** (`DEMO_age`): Continuous variable representing respondents' ages, grouped into age brackets for analysis.\n",
    "     - **Gender** (`DEMO_gender`): Categorical variable capturing gender identity.\n",
    "     - **Identity Groups** (`DEMO_identity_*` variables): Categorical variables capturing specific identity group membership, such as `DEMO_identity_lgbtq` for LGBTQ2+ individuals and `DEMO_identity_disability` for those with disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Visualization**: Grouped bar charts for each core activity (sleeping, working, socializing), with satisfaction responses categorized by each demographic group (e.g., age, gender, identity groups). This visualization will make it easy to observe patterns in time-use satisfaction across demographic lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis Plan**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use Chi-square tests for independence to assess whether satisfaction levels for each core activity (sleeping, working, socializing) are significantly associated with demographic variables such as age, gender, and identity group membership.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**: The chi-square test requires that each cell has an expected frequency of at least five for validity. This assumption will be checked, and adjustments will be made if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hypothesis and Expected Results**:\n",
    "   - **Hypotheses**:\n",
    "     - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no significant association between demographic characteristics (age, gender, identity group membership) and satisfaction levels for time spent on sleeping, working, and socializing.\n",
    "     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is a significant association between demographic characteristics and satisfaction levels for time spent on at least one of the core activities.\n",
    "   - **Expected Results and Relevance**: \n",
    "     - It is expected that younger individuals or members of specific identity groups (such as LGBTQ2+ or people with disabilities) may report less satisfaction with time spent on work and social activities due to lifestyle constraints. Identifying these associations can help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving lifestyle balance for affected groups, addressing potential inequities in time-use satisfaction."

    "### Analysis 2: Family and Personal Time Satisfaction by Demographic Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Question**: \n",
    "   - Are satisfaction levels for family time, personal \"me time,\" and winding down activities associated with demographic factors such as relationship status, gender, and identity group membership?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Outcome Variables**:\n",
    "     - **Family Time Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_family`): Categorical variable indicating satisfaction with time spent with family.\n",
    "     - **Me Time Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_me`): Categorical variable indicating satisfaction with time spent on \"me time.\"\n",
    "     - **Winding Down Satisfaction** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_winding_down`): Categorical variable indicating satisfaction with time spent winding down.\n",
    "   - **Predictor Variables**:\n",
    "     - **Relationship Status** (`DEMO_relationship_status`): Categorical variable indicating respondents' relationship status (e.g., single, married).\n",
    "     - **Gender** (`DEMO_gender`): Categorical variable for gender identity.\n",
    "     - **Identity Groups** (`DEMO_identity_*`): Categorical variables for identity group membership.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Visualization**: Stacked bar charts displaying the proportion of satisfaction levels for each activity (family time, me time, winding down) across demographic categories. This will help identify which groups are more or less satisfied with their family and personal time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis Plan**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Perform Chi-square tests for independence to determine if there are significant associations between demographic variables (relationship status, gender, identity groups) and satisfaction levels for family time, me time, and winding down.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**: Assumes adequate sample sizes in each category of satisfaction response for valid chi-square tests. This assumption will be checked, and adjustments will be made if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hypothesis and Expected Results**:\n",
    "   - **Hypotheses**:\n",
    "     - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no significant association between demographic characteristics and satisfaction with family time, me time, and winding down.\n",
    "     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is a significant association between demographic characteristics and satisfaction with one or more of these time categories.\n",
    "   - **Expected Results and Relevance**:\n",
    "     - It is anticipated that individuals from specific demographic groups (e.g., non-traditional relationship statuses or people with disabilities) may report lower satisfaction with family and personal time. This analysis could highlight areas for targeted support, such as programs that facilitate work-life balance or mental health initiatives, for under-satisfied groups."

    "### Analysis 3: Discrepancies Between Actual and Desired Time Use Priorities by Demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Question**:\n",
    "   - Do demographic factors like age, gender, and identity group membership influence discrepancies between actual and desired priorities for key activities, such as exercise, sleep, and family time?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Outcome Variables**:\n",
    "     - **Actual vs. Desired Exercise Priority** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_exercise_actual` vs. `LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_exercise_desired`): Numerical difference in priority ranking for exercise.\n",
    "     - **Actual vs. Desired Sleep Priority** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_sleep_actual` vs. `LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_sleep_desired`): Numerical difference in priority ranking for sleep.\n",
    "     - **Actual vs. Desired Family Time Priority** (`LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_family_time_actual` vs. `LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_family_desired`): Numerical difference in priority ranking for family time.\n",
    "   - **Predictor Variables**:\n",

    "     - **Identity Groups** (`DEMO_identity_*`): Categorical variables for specific identity group membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Visualization**: Use paired boxplots or line plots to visualize the differences between actual and desired priorities for each activity, with data separated by demographic groups. This will clearly display any discrepancies and help highlight demographic trends in time-use priority satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis Plan**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Paired t-tests to evaluate if there is a significant difference between actual and desired priorities for each activity within each demographic group.\n",
    "   - **Assumptions**: Assumes normally distributed differences between actual and desired priority rankings for valid paired t-tests. This will be checked and adjusted if necessary.\n",

    "   - **Hypotheses**:\n",
    "     - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no significant difference between actual and desired priorities for the key activities across demographic groups.\n",
    "     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is a significant difference between actual and desired priorities, indicating a discrepancy in lifestyle satisfaction for one or more demographic groups.\n",
    "   - **Expected Results and Relevance**:\n",
    "     - It is likely that younger individuals or specific identity groups may experience greater discrepancies between actual and desired time priorities, suggesting barriers to achieving their preferred time balance. This insight could help inform strategies to support these groups in aligning their daily routines with personal values, fostering improved life satisfaction."
